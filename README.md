# odin-recipes

The first project in The Odin Project Foundations curriculum.

In this project, I an able to showcase the use of HTML headings, paragraphs, ordered/unordered lists, images as well as the use of links.  I also utilized the Terminal to create folders/files to keep the project organized properly.
