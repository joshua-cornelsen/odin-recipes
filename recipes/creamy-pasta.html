        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>3 (6 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup heavy whipping cream</li>

        <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>

        <li>1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 small bunch fresh basil, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking dish.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until
                tender yet firm to
                the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup cooking water.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook onion in oil until soft and translucent, about 5
                minutes. Add
                garlic and cook for an additional 30 seconds. Stir in tomato sauce and tomato paste and cook until
                slightly reduced,
                about 5 minutes. Add cream and Parmesan cheese. Season with sugar, salt, and pepper.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Stir some of the reserved pasta water into sauce and add cooked penne. Remove from the heat and stir in
                cherry tomatoes,
                1/2 of the mozzarella cheese, and basil. Add more pasta water if needed to reach desired consistency.
                Pour penne mixture
                into the prepared baking dish and cover with remaining mozzarella cheese.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and cheese is melted, about 20 minutes.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
